P&G Household Essentials Sale

In addition to all the great Amazon gift card deals that are available right now, there’s a special promotion that all of our readers should take advantage of.

In a nutshell, Amazon is offering a $20 Amazon credit when you purchase at least $80 worth of household essentials from various P&G brands. As most people know, Proctor & Gamble is a massive company that owns so many top brands. Examples included in this sale are Bounty, Charmin, Always, Gilette, Tide, Pampers, Downy, Cascade, Dawn, Swiffer, and more.

Simply head to the sale page on Amazon and add at least $80 worth of items to your cart. Then, just check out, and you’re done. You don’t need to enter any coupon code or do anything else. Once your order is processed and it ships, Amazon will automatically add the $20 Amazon credit to your account.

According to the terms and conditions at the bottom of the sale page, this promo only lasts for a “limited time” with no end date specified. We’ve already seen variations of this promotion come and go four times though, and they typically stick around for a few weeks each time.

Also of note, the current iteration of this promo says that your $20 Amazon credit must be used by December 31, 2024. That gives you plenty of time to cash in on your Amazon gift card credit.

Something important to keep in mind when it comes to this P&G promotion is that you can take advantage of the deal multiple times. In other words, even if you already scored an Amazon credit from the last P&G promo, you can still get another $20 Amazon credit right now from the current promotion.

I have personally used this deal four times now, and I’ve received four different Amazon credits as a result. There’s nothing stopping you from doing the same thing.

The most recent P&G promo was a couple of months ago, and it lasted for around three weeks. It was extremely popular with our readers, too. You should definitely take advantage of this new promotion while you still can. If you miss it though, you probably shouldn’t be too concerned since it’ll undoubtedly be back again next month.

There are a bunch of terms and conditions for this promotion. Only certain customers are eligible, and there are other restrictions, too.

The deal page says that only people who receive an “Add-a-card” promo email or are served an advertisement for the promo can take advantage. Of course, how do you know if you were served an ad and missed it? Also, the email notifying you of this promotion might’ve been caught by your spam filter.
